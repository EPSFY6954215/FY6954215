  This project provides an overview of synthetic fuels focusing on: their production processes ,benefits of synthetic fuels, limitations 
  and potential strategies to make synthetic fuels viable for mainstream use.
  These subtopics will provide insight to determine whether synthetic fuel is sustainable for the future.

  The transportation industry is evolving at a significant pace to meet deadlines set under tightening international regulations.
  Synthetic fuels have emerged to be the carbon-neutral solution for internal combustion engines. 
  Currently, synthetic fuels are being utilized in motorsports such as the dakar rally, formula 1 and in the operation of historic vehicles.
  Currently the market of synthetic fuel is expected to surpass $115 billion by 2026, this shows a clear demand to achieve net-zero emissions for transportation. 
  Companies such as Audi, Porsche, BMW and business start-ups are all investing heavily into synthetic fuel production(Saxtons, 2025).

The production of sustainable fuels breaks down to these processes: carbon capture, Electrolysis, syngas production, fuel synthesis and refining.
 
C02 capture is coupled to a chemical reaction in a way that improves energy efficiency. This method holds importance to make production of sustainable fuel carbon neutral, The chemicals used for absorption usually Involves an amine based solvent, for example, monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA) and di-isopropanol amine in an aqueous solution to capture the CO2 (John, Tomas and Melis 2022, pp2).

Electrolysis involves the separation of oxygen and hydrogen from water. 
This process is achieved by two electrodes, made with conductive materials such as graphene, an anode(positive charge) forms oxygen gas and electrode(negative charge) that forms hydrogen gas-hydrogen gas is the main component required to form synthetic fuel.
Between the two electrodes, there is a membrane that's produced from specific polymers such as perfluorosulfonic acid that allow positive and negative ions to pass through however restricts the mix of gases preventing combustion. 
The energy required for this process can be obtained using sustainable methods such as using solar energy.

Syngas production

Syngas production produces synthetic gas( composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) through the formation of carbon–carbon bonds,
upgrading the single-carbon components of synthesis gas to various intermediate and final products of the fuel and chemical industry is possible (Jhon, Gregory 2023).

Refining

This process involves the Fischer-Tropsch method that converts synthetic gas to synthetic fuel.
The gas is passed over a metal catalyst, mainly iron, This causes the gas to convert into liquid form. 
High temperatures are required to produce the pressure required to perform this process.
