  This project provides an overview of synthetic fuels focusing on: their production processes ,benefits of synthetic fuels, limitations 
  and potential strategies to make synthetic fuels viable for mainstream use.
  These subtopics will provide insight to determine whether synthetic fuel is sustainable for the future.

<h3 id="Introduction">introduction</h3>

<P class="ex1">
<pre>
  The transportation industry is evolving at a significant pace to meet deadlines set under tightening international regulations.
  Synthetic fuels have emerged to be the carbon-neutral solution for internal combustion engines. 
  Currently, synthetic fuels are being utilized in motorsports such as the dakar rally, formula 1 and in the operation of historic vehicles.
  Currently the market of synthetic fuel is expected to surpass $115 billion by 2026, this shows a clear demand to achieve net-zero emissions for transportation. 
  Companies such as Audi, Porsche, BMW and business start-ups are all investing heavily into synthetic fuel production(Saxtons, 2025).

<h3 id="Production of synthetic fuels">Production of synthetic fuels</h3>

<P class="ex1">
<pre>
The production of sustainable fuels breaks down to these processes: carbon capture, Electrolysis, syngas production, fuel synthesis and refining.
 
C02 capture is coupled to a chemical reaction in a way that improves energy efficiency.
This method holds importance to make production of sustainable fuel carbon neutral.
The chemicals used for absorption usually Involves an amine based solvent, for example:
monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA) and di-isopropanol amine in an aqueous solution to capture the CO2 (John, Tomas and Melis 2022, pp2).

Electrolysis involves the separation of oxygen and hydrogen from water. 
This process is achieved by two electrodes, made with conductive materials such as graphene, an anode(positive charge) forms oxygen gas and electrode(negative charge) that forms hydrogen gas-hydrogen gas is the main component required to form synthetic fuel.
Between the two electrodes, there is a membrane that's produced from specific polymers such as perfluorosulfonic acid that allow positive and negative ions to pass through however restricts the mix of gases preventing combustion. 
The energy required for this process can be obtained using sustainable methods such as using solar energy.

Syngas production

Syngas production produces synthetic gas( composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) through the formation of carbon–carbon bonds,
upgrading the single-carbon components of synthesis gas to various intermediate and final products of the fuel and chemical industry is possible (Jhon, Gregory 2023).

Refining

This process involves the Fischer-Tropsch method that converts synthetic gas to synthetic fuel.
The gas is passed over a metal catalyst, mainly iron, This causes the gas to convert into liquid form. 
High temperatures are required to produce the pressure required to perform this process.

<h3 id="Benefits">Benefits</h3>

<P class="ex1">
<pre>

Advantages for using synthetic fuel such as providing more fuel sources to meet demands, could overall reduce the cost of fuel long term and more countries would be able to manufacture this fuel as there's less finite resources used to produce the fuel. 
The fuel can be used in any combustion engine vehicle without modifications to the engine or fuel system.
The main factor of this fuel is that its carbon neutral as the carbon absorbed for manufacturing the fuel for one tank is equal to the emissions emitted when the fuel is burned, synthetic fuels can potentially 90% reduction of C02 compared to fossil fuels. 
The fuel has the same chemical structure as regular petrol, this means there's no additional infrastructure needed to fuel up vehicles as the fuel can be used in petrol stations(Saxtons, 2025).

<h3 id="Downsides and Competitors">Downsides and Competitors</h3>

<P class="ex1">
<pre>

Currently the cost of synthetic fuel is about £3.80 per litre, This is a significant cost over the cost of petrol which is on average £1.63 per litre(Benjamin, 2023). 
reasons for this expense are: the extra processes involved to produce the fuel such as using electrolysis which requires a significant amount of electricity, the manufacturing process is only 50 to 60% efficient (Saxtons, 2025) and the reliance on precious earth materials in production methods.
Currently electric vehicles are the main innovation for sustainable automobiles. In the 3rd financial quarter of 2025, EV car sales have reached their highest at 30% (Carwow) compared to other types of vehicle. However EV and hybrid technology isn’t sufficient to make automobiles fully sustainable, this is due to the slow development of infrastructure required to charge the batteries and the materials used to develop the batteries include lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese and graphite.
These are finite resources found underground therefore affecting local landscape and also the logistics required to transport materials for production. The outcome of this is 1.3 to 2 times more carbon dioxide emitted to produce EV compared to petrol vehicles(James, 2025).

<h3 id="Potential solutions">Potential solutions</h3>

<P class="ex1">
<pre>

Due to the high cost of materials used for the production synthetic fuel, there are several researchers developing ways to reduce this, this includes: 

Palladium filters: Palladium is a metal that has high resistance to gases apart from hydrogen, therefore making it effective as a filter to produce pure hydrogen.
Due to its ideal thermal characteristics, it can be used with processes such as steam methane reforming (Jennifer, 2025).

Iridium coating: iridium is used in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers. 
The platinum group metal is one of the rarest on Earth, with just 7-8 tonnes mined each year, hampering PEM production and driving up costs. 
To reduce this cost VSparticle has innovated with the nanoporous catalyst layer, this coats the Iridium coating, reducing the usage of Iridium by 90%(The Engineer, 2025).

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<P class="ex1">
<pre>

Synthetic fuel is a viable option to provide sustainable energy for transportation. 
With consideration of the downsides that restricts feasibility of commercialising the fuel for mainstream use, the current research and development in reducing the cost of manufacturing the fuel will remove these limitations as they innovate on removing the wastage of material in the electrolysis process and making the manufacturing 
more efficient.
